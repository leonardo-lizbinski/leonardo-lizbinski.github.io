Brown Medical School
======
* BIOL6710: Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Modern Medicine
  * FOUNDER and Course Leader, Spring 2021
  * Faculty Adviser: Martin Weinstock MD PhD
  * Course Description: This course aims to introduce Brown medical students to the core principles and practice of innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of modern medicine. The landscape of medicine is constantly innovating and adapting to new unmet medical needs. The challenges that physicians and innovators encounter every day are critical to understand. We encourage students to think outside-the-box and deeply about potential solutions within specific fields of medicine and healthcare. Each session, we will examine one new medical challenge and explore how talented entrepreneurs are addressing these demands in real-world settings. We will investigate and discuss the structure of each healthcare system to learn more about their intricate functions (from public health to medicine and business) and explore potential routes for innovation. This will be especially helpful for those who want to learn more about healthcare systems, design innovative solutions, or even become an entrepreneur in the future.
